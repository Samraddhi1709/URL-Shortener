  ## Technologies Used

    mongoose
    MongoDB



## How It Works

  ### 1. For generate short url
For every original URL you provide, a random string is generated and appended to the project's hosting domain to create a short URL. The short URL is then mapped to the original URL. So, when you access the short URL, it automatically redirects you to the original URL.
    

  ### 2. For search url

 You can search for URLs by one the following

  - full url (original url)

  - short url (generate url)

  - short url but not include domain name (on which project run) like if your generated short url is "http://localhost:8080/dsffhfpj" then you are able to search with "dsffhfpj" , you don't need to search by whole short url


  The search result will provide you full url , short url that are generated and number of clicks that short url get


  ### 3. Authentication


  - During the signup process, your email ID is used, and your password is securely hashed and saved in the MongoDB database.

  - When you log in with the correct email and password, a JSON token is generated by the server and stored in browser cookies.

  - This token has an expiration time of 1 hour.

  The next time you visit (before token exprire) the website where the project is running, the server verifies your token. You won't need to log in again, and you can access the resources of the website.
